> The secret of disruptive innovations and business models isn’t that they disrupt ‘the industry’, it’s that they disrupt people. __They change how people feel about something enough to change how they behave__. It’s entirely possible to look into the future and think about how your customer might be changed tomorrow as a result of what you do today. While ‘the industry’ works on the assumption that the larvae of today will just be bigger caterpillars tomorrow, the disruptor imagines butterflies.
